\chapter{Use of Approximated Histograms for Genome Size Estimation}
In this chapter we provide a more detailed description of a probabilistic model
that estimates genome characteristics using only $k$-mer abundance histogram.
This model was presented in \cite{Hozza2015, Hozza2016} and was implemented in a software CovEst.
