\chapter{Analysis of Errors and Optimization}

To be able to base our estimates of genome size on approximate $k$-mer abundance histogram,
we must investigate the character of inaccuracies of estimated histogram. As we conclude
that histograms are suitable for further usage, we optimze the algorithm computing the histogram. 

\chapter{Testing}

In this chapter we evaluate the performance and accuracy of our algorithm on both simulated
and real data.
